Banking Campaign Analysis
Banking institutions earn money in many ways and Term deposits are considered one of the major sources for the same. These deposits usually have a short maturity period and money is invested at an agreed rate of interest. Telephonic marketing is one of the best ways to reach out to people at large to inform and attract them for term deposits. Based on the previous data collected, we can figure out the collective of people interested in making a term deposit considering a variety of factors like age, education, etc. This way, a lot of resources like time and money can be saved and can effectively attract a larger set of audiences.
The dataset we have used is of a Portuguese banking institution from Kaggle and is related to telephonic marketing campaigns. The dataset consists of about 45,000 rows and 18 columns and is over a period of two years. The 18 columns present are as follows:
1.	age: Describes age of the customers.
2.	job: Describes profession of the customers (management, technician, entrepreneur,
blue-collar, unknown, retired, admin, services, self-employed, unemployed, housemaid, st udent).
3.	marital: Describes marital status of customers (married, single, divorced).
4.	education: Describes the education status of customers (unknown, secondary, tertiary).
